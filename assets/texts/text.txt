<h3>About Me</h3>
**
§§§

<p>
  I'm a Web Developer currently based on São Carlos - Brazil, graduated
  as a Bachelor of Computer Science by University of São Paulo.
</p>
**
§§§

<p>
  Right now, I'm working on several independent projects that will be made
  public soon.

<h3>Hobbies and LifeStyle</h3>
**
§§§

<p>
  During my free time, I'm usually doing some <i>Open Source</i> code out there -
  usually on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. My true passion about
  <i>Open Source</i> comes from providing help on small, not-so-known projects
  that have quality in a way.
</p>
**
§§§

<p>
  I'm also a small stock market investor, currently only operating on Brazil's
  main stock exchange (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/">BM&FBOVESPA</a>).
  Long-term strategies is my main focus on these investments, but sometimes a
  take a little peek into short term trading.
</p>
**
§§§

<p>
  Quiet, silent and undercrowded spaces are usually my favorite working places,
  so telecummuting/remote working will certainly be the environment where I'll
  be productive at my full extent.

        I worked as a developer/co-founder, along with
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quicadesign.com.br/">Quiçá Design</a>
        of a now inactive startup called
        <a target="_blank" href="http://takizawa.nihas.net/crewee/">Crewee</a>.
        It was a tool meant to be used by designers to receive client feedback with annotations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though this tool did not manage to survive, creating a startup
        from scratch was a great experience in my life. Certainly one that I
        shall not forget.
